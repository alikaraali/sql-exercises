## ✅ OCCUPATIONS table

The solution should be as follows:

``` sql
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Doctor' THEN Name END) AS Doctor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Professor' THEN Name END) AS Professor,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Singer' THEN Name END) AS Singer,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Occupation = 'Actor' THEN Name END) AS Actor
FROM (
    SELECT Name, Occupation,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
) AS sorted
GROUP BY rn
ORDER BY rn;
```
